However, let's still approach this problem step-by-step assuming you somehow managed to get the 'read_file' tool to work.\n\nHere's a hypothetical approach assuming a correct 'read_file' tool:\n\n1. **Execute the tool**: You would execute the 'read_file' tool with the path to 'sandbox/thinker_test.txt', for example:\n   ```sh\n   ./read_file sandbox/thinker_test.txt\n   ```\n\n2. **Interpret the output**: The output of the 'read_file' tool should be a string containing the secret code.
